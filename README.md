The dataset was reconstructed to train a neural network performing dense particle image velocimetry. Both images and flow fields in the dataset are all 256×256 pixels in size. Three types of occlusion blocks, with sizes of 12×24, 24×24, and 24×12 pixels and a grayscale value of zero, are positioned randomly to each particle image pair.

## Data description
This dataset contains 14150 image pairs and corresponding true value flow fields with 8 types. Because the training set is too large, it is difficult to upload data. You can download the data from Baidu Cloud: URL:  https://pan.baidu.com/s/1H2i5H0zYYvAZYOqh5U368Q?pwd=a72e
